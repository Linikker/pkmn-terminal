# 🐍 pknn-terminal

**A lightweight, text-based Pokémon-style battle simulator built entirely for the terminal.**  
Born from a hand-drawn concept, **pknn-terminal** started as a fun idea on paper and evolved into a simple yet entertaining prototype designed to run anywhere — no fancy graphics, no installations, just pure terminal fun.
